/*
 * Vampire
 *
 * This class is derived from Character.  It is a NPC (Non-Player Character).
 *
 * The vampire doesn't move but it will immediately attack the player if adjacent.
 * Most likely you will want to place the vampire to block a door.
 *
 * The vampire is strong with a lot of HP and does a lot of damage.
 * However, it will die immediately if the player has vampire spray.
